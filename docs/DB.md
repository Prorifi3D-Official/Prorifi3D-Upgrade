- Put Y Belt Clip into Y Belt Holder B, the upper cover of the Y holder.

- Attach Y Belt Holder B to Y Belt Holder A. Make sure you turn the screws on both sides evenly in turn.

### 1.4 The final assembly

- Put the Dual belt driving pulley on the Y motor shaft, as close to the motor side as possible, leaving a very small gap only. Make sure the pulley is not touching the motor.

- Put the timing belt around the pulley, let the teeth match the belt

- Install Y tensioner mount to the original position using the original screws.

- Install the adjusting screw(M3x12mm) and leave a proper distance. If the belt does not fully match the driving pulley or the left and right belt does not have the same tension. Just move the Y carriage back and forth when the belt is under tension until the two belts are working properly.

- We will fine tune the belt tension later according to the printing test.
