# Stage 2:Frame Upgrades & Dual Belt Plus

## 1. Preparation

### 1.0 Introduction

<span style="color:red"> **READ THE INSTRUCTION BEFORE UPGRADE!!** </span>  

- Since you are upgrading an existing Original Prusa or clone, if you have experience in assembling Original i3, that’s perfect! if not, don’t worry, follow this guide, everything will be smooth and fine. Also feel free to contact us.

- Disclaimer: We share these guides to make your experience as smooth as possible. However, you are responsible for your upgrade, assembly, and any damage you cause to your hardware.

### 1.1 Check before Upgrade

Make sure you have the following tools and things available：

1. Your Original i3 

2. 4mm, 3mm, 2.5mm, 2mm, and 1.5mm hex keys for disassembly, you can find one 1.5mm hex key in our accessory pack if you do not have one.

3. A cutting tool for cutting zip ties 

4. Your Prorifi3D upgrade kit 

5. A box for keeping the screws 

6. Printed parts from [our GitHub](https://github.com/Prorifi3D-Official/Prorifi3D-Upgrades)

7. Open the Original Prusa i3 MK3S kit assembly Guide for reference([https://help.prusa3d.com/en/guide/1-introduction_24976](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/guide/1-introduction_24976))

8. Make sure you have a **flat surface** such as a polished marble top, or a big ceramic tile. This surface will be your base level.

- Make sure the filament is **unloaded** before the upgrade. You will have to turn the printer over during the process so the filament spool and spool holder need to be removed before the upgrade.

- Make sure your printer is **Not powered**, the nozzle and heated bed are fully cooled to room temperature! Otherwise, you may injure yourself!

- Make sure **both** ends of the power cord is unplugged to allow the printer to be placed sidewise.

- For disassembling the Original i3 you can refer to this guide:[https://guides.bear-lab.com/Guide/02.+Preflight+check+and+disassembly/42?lang=en](https://guides.bear-lab.com/Guide/02.+Preflight+check+and+disassembly/42?lang=en)

- For the Dual Belt Plus please use PETG with at least 30% infill. The printed part should orientate as shown. Note that this part can be printed without support.

## 2. Assemble the Main Frame

### 2.0 Check before the assembly

- Make sure you have the following parts: All the aluminum profiles, your Hex Keys, Accessory Pack 1

- A measuring tool for screws, you can find the STL file [here](https://github.com/Prorifi3D-Official/Prorifi3D-Upgrades/tree/main/Tools) (If you know how to measure the screws then use a ruler instead)

- Make sure you have a flat and big enough surface such as a polished marble top, or a big ceramic tile. This surface must be able to fit the longest Aluminum profile in any direction. Clean the surface to remove any dust or small debris.

- Check the inside of the two longest beams, there should be two plastic plugs been pre-installed at both ends. If not, please contact us.

### 2.1 Assemble the gantry

- Take the left and right vertical beams (the longest ones).

- Check the beam and make sure you have the correct orientation. The <span style="color:green">side with chamfers</span> should face downward, against the flat surface. The side indicated by the <span style="color:blue">blue arrow</span> should face outward.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/370.png)

- Take the short <span style="color:blue">4040 profile</span> and place them as shown. The side with Chamfers needs to be facing down, against the flat surface.

- Use one <span style="color:green">2040 beam</span> as the jig, place it as shown

- Note the <span style="color:red">orientation!</span> The 4040 should on the side with 3 screw holes. 

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/gantry.png)

- Use M5x45 screws from Accessory Pack 1 and tighten the screws as shown on both sides. Note the <span style="color:green">Upper one</span> is for adjustments. Do not fully tighten it.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/gantryScrew.png)

- Adjust the <span style="color:green">upper screws</span> on **both** sides evenly to make sure the 2040 beam used as a jig can just about move freely up and down at the open end of the gantry

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/jigmove.png)

### 2.2 Assemble the base

- Take the rest 4040 and 2040 profiles

- Check the beam and make sure you have the correct orientation. The side with chamfers needs to be facing down, against the flat surface. The sinkholes should face out as the green arrow shows. The front and rear 2040 profiles are the same, just make sure you have the correct side facing out and <span style="color:green">chamfered side</span> facing down.

- Place them as shown. Note that for the 4040 profiles, be careful with the position of the <span style="color:blue">screw holes</span>. Make sure you have the correct relative position!

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/baseView.png)

- Insert 2 T-Nut in the bottom <span style="color:blue">inner slot</span> of the 4040 profile, do this for both left and right 4040 profiles. These will be used to fix the footpad later.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/insertTnut.png)

- Insert 6 T-nut in the <span style="color:blue">upper slot</span> of the inner side of the rear 2040 profile and insert 1 in the <span style="color:green">lower slot</span>.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/baseRear_tnut.png)

- Insert 6 T-nut in the <span style="color:blue">upper slot</span> of the inner side of the front 2040 profile and insert 2 in the <span style="color:green">lower slot</span>.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/baseFront_tnut.png)

- Double-check if you insert the correct amount of T-nuts and they are in the correct position!

- Now we can build the base. Make sure both sides are aligned. You can use a piece of a flat surface, such as the jigs you printed to help you align these beams.

- Take the M5x25 screws, you need 16 of them. Use them to fix the front and rear profiles. Make sure you tighten them in a diagonal order. When tightening the screws, do not fully tighten a screw before you tighten the next one. Screw them in evenly. <span style="color:red">Make sure all the aluminum profiles are not moved or have gaps with the flat surface</span>. This is very important!

- Turn the base over and install the footpad. Use M5x10 button head screws to fix them. Turn the base back and if it shakes, adjust the screws on footpads until they are all in the same plane.

### 2.3 Assemble the mainframe

- Check if the T-nuts are correctly inserted again before this part!

- Make sure the reference surface (the side with chamfers) for the base is facing downwards, against the flat surface. At this point, the reference surface should be flat and directly touching the flat surface with no gaps between.

- Take the gantry, make sure you have the correct orientation!

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/M_frame.png)

- As you can see, on the lower end of the gantry there are 4 screw holes on each side, and they are shaped differently. Viewed from one side, the upper left one is the pinhole. And the 4 screw holes match the holes on the base.

- Carefully match the gantry and the base. Take a shoulder screw(the one with steel case) and insert it into the <span style="color:blue">upper left</span> pinhole to the bottom, slightly tighten this screw. It is ok if you feel some force or resistance when inserting this screw.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/pinscrew.png)

- Do the same for the other side. Now the position of the base and gantry are locked and make sure the gantry stands against the flat surface, there should be no gap between the gantry end and the surface, or the base and surface.

- Now the gantry is perpendicular to the base, take the M5x70 screw (the longest normal screw) and install them to the lower right hole on each side. 

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/FM5x70Screw.png)

- Take 4 M5x50 screws to fill the rest screw holes. 

- Now you should tighten the screws evenly in a diagonal order. Note that the shoulder screw is for positioning thus cannot be tightened much. Make sure the rest M5 screws are fully tightened!

- The main frame is now finished, if perfectly assembled you should see no gap between the base and the flat surface you have. And if you shake the gantry, there should be absolutely no relative movement between the gantry and the base.

### 2.4 Prepare the next phase

- At this point, we just finished the main frame and are moving to the next phase. It is time to take the **accessory pack 2**. There are many screws in it so be careful. You will find screws with the socket head cap, the button head cap, the flat head cap, and the countersunk screws. You can use the [measuring tool](https://github.com/Prorifi3D-Official/Prorifi3D-Upgrades/tree/main/Tools) to help you classify the screw.

- If you found anything confusing or are not sure, you can always reach out to us!




## 3. Disassemble your Original i3

- For disassembling the Original i3 you can refer to the bear guide:[https://guides.bear-lab.com/Guide/02.+Preflight+check+and+disassembly/42?lang=en](https://guides.bear-lab.com/Guide/02.+Preflight+check+and+disassembly/42?lang=en)

- The Bear upgrade is also a decent frame upgrade and we took some inspiration from it despite using a completely different approach and mechanical design principles.

- The part you need to keep and reuse later:

	- The entire X-axis and E-axis

	- The PSU

	- The Y-axis, including the rod, but without the belt system

	- The Control board and the control box

	- The Z rods

	- The Z motors, if you did not get the full upgrade kit

	- The LCD

	- The Control Box

## 4. Build the Machine

### 4.0 Screws and nuts

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/screw.png)

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Nut.png)

- Let us start with the Z-axis first. Take the Z rod from you recycled from your Original i3 and the left and right Z Motor Mounts

- First, put the <span style="color:green">Z motors</span> into the motor mounts firmly and install the <span style="color:blue">steel rods</span> first. Z motor here is used as a jig.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Zaxis_1.png)

- Then, remove the Z motors. Make sure the rod stays firmly on the motor mounts and the <span style="color:red">bottom end</span> of the rod does not stick out the printed parts.

- Insert <span style="color:blue">flat head M5x10</span> on the Z motor mounts, then hook T nut on the screws.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Zaxis_2.png)

- Slide the Z motor mount into the slots from the top. Make sure you have the correct orientation.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Zaxis_3.png)

- Press the printed part sideways against the profile and slide them to the position where printed parts are just about to touch the base, as shown in the picture below.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Zaxis_4.png)

- Tighten the screws to make sure it does not move freely. Do this for both left and right z motor mount.

- Now carefully reinstall the X-axis, be careful with the linear bearings! You should lower the X-axis evenly. Do not proceed if you feel too much resistance or force, the linear bearings are <span style="color:red">**very very easy to break!**</span>

- Take the Left and right Z top, insert <span style="color:blue">M5x10 flat head</span> at the front and <span style="color:green">M5x12 flat head</span> at sides. Hook hammer nuts on the screws and then install the Z top. The Z steel rods should be in the <span style="color:red">slots</span> on the Z top and will not fall out. Then tighten all the M5 flat head screws.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Zaxis_5.png)

Use <span style="color:blue">M4x5 set screws</span> to fix the back end of the Z top.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Zaxis_6.png)

- Do this for both left and right sides.

## 4.2 Z motors

- Now it is time to install the Z motors. Make sure you have the correct Z motors. The one with shorter wires should be closer to the control box! (which is at left when viewing from the front)

- Put the motors in from the bottom. Rotated the leading screw evenly to allow the motors to be in position. The printed parts have slots for wires to pass through. Make sure no wires are clamped or twisted.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Zaxis_7.png)

Use <span style="color:blue">M3x12 screws</span> to fix the motors. You should tighten the screws evenly in a diagonal order.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Zaxis_8.png)

Install the Bottom cover at the end of the gantry beams and fix them with <span style="color:blue">M4x5 set screws</span> on both left and right sides.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Zaxis_9.png)

- Collect the wires and proceed to the next step


### 4.3 Y-axis

- Take the 4 Y rod holder, insert the square nut and pre-install the <span style="color:blue">M3x12 set screws</span> (the longer one) Make sure you have the correct orientation of the set screws

- Install Y rod holder, be careful with the orientation. 

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Yaxis_1.png)

- Use the positioning jig and hex key to slide the T nut to the correct position. Place the T-nut to where the screws holes hould be. Do this for all 4 positions.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Yaxis_rod_jig.png)

- Now carefully put the entire Y-axis back from the top. Slide Y carriage to make sure the movement is smooth.

- Now use the M5x10 button head to fix the left 2 <span style="color:blue">Y rod holders</span>. If you feel the T nut is not in position, try using the hex key to help align the T-nuts first.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Yaxis_2.png)

- Slide the Y carriage back and forth to make sure the right Y rod is in the ideal position.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Yaxis_3.png)

- Tighten the screws of the 2 right <span style="color:blue">Y rod holders</span>

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Yaxis_4.png)

- Slide the Y carriage back and forth and check if it moves smoothly. If not, untighten the screws on the right 2 Y rod holder and repeat the previous 2 steps to make sure the Y rods are parallel to each other.

- Now take the Y motor mount and Y motor, first install the Y motor to motor mounts use M3x14 screws, make sure the wire comes out from the bottom

- Now insert 3 socket cap M5x10 screws into the Y motor mount.

- Adjust the pre-inserted T-nuts to an ideal position, hook the T-nuts with the M5 screws on your Y motor mount.

- Slightly tighten the screw to make sure the printed parts do not fall off, make sure it can still move freely

- Use the <span style="color:green">jig</span> as shown to position the Y motor mount.

- Press the <span style="color:blue">printed part</span> against the base and tighten the screws.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Yaxis_5.png)

- Take out the  Y-Belt-Idler-A, Insert one nylon nut as shown

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Yaxis_7.png)

- Insert another nylon nut here

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Yaxis_8.png)

- Insert 4 socket cap M5x10 screws. Hook the T-nut with the screws and then use the <span style="color:green">motor jig</span> to position the idler.

- Press the <span style="color:blue">printed part</span> against the base to make it parallel to the reference surface and tighten the screws.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Yaxis_6.png)

### 4.4 The control box

- Take the Electronics-Cover-Holder-C, insert 2 M5x10 button cap screws and hook the hammer nut on the screws. Install them at the back of the left gantry beam. Note the <span style="color:blue">printed part surface</span> should be at the same level as the base.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/cbox_support.png)

- You can reuse most of your old control box. However, there are some additional parts.

- Insert the <span style="color:blue">hex nut</span> into these positions and change the screws to M3x15 at these positions.

- Insert one <span style="color:green">flat cap M5x8 screw</span>, then hook 1 hammer nut on the M5x8 screw.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/cbox_1.png)

- The final control box should look like this.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/cbox_2.png)

### 4.5 PSU

- Take the PSU and PSU-Holders, Install the holder on PSU with <span style="color:blue">M4x8 countersunk screws</span>

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/PSU_1.png)

- Install <span style="color:blue">M3x6 screws</span> here and hook the <span style="color:blue">M3 hammer nut</span> at the back If you have the black PSU

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/PSU_3.png)

- Insert M3x8 screws here and hook the M3 hammer nut at the back If you have the old version silver PSU. Replace the old bottom cap with the new one so that wires can go from the bottom.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/PSU_4.png)

- Install the PSU on the frame, make sure the screws are tightened properly

### 4.6 LCD

- Take the LCD supports, the installation for LCD support is the same as original ones. You can refer to the guide here: [https://help.prusa3d.com/en/guide/6-lcd-assembly_172423](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/guide/6-lcd-assembly_172423)

- Connect the electronics first, make sure you have the correct wires.

- Use the <span style="color:blue">M5x10 button cap screws</span> and hammer nut to fix the LCD on the main frame. The wires should be able to bend and go through the bottom of the base.


![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/LCD_1.png)

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/LCD_2.png)

### 4.7 Endcaps

- Install the endcaps with M4x5 set screws

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/end_cover.png)


## 5. The Dual Belt Plus system


### 5.1 Remove the original Y axis parts

- Turn the printer sidewise, make sure the printer stay still

- Take off the original Y belt holder and the orignal Y belt from the Y carriage

### 5.2 Install the new Y-Belt-Holder-A

- Take the Y-Belt-Holder-A and install it to the Y carriage using two M3x10 screws as shown. Make sure you have the correct orientation.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/db/db0.png)

### 5.3 Assemble the Y tensioner

If you have the older Dual Belt instead of Dual Belt Plus, please refer to the archive [here](./DB.md)

- The printed parts should look the same as shown in the picture. Note that this part is not symmetric.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Dual_Belt_Plus/DB+1.JPG) | ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Dual_Belt_Plus/DB+2.JPG)


- Insert your hex key into the Y tensioner and place the bearings on the hex key one by one as shown. Guide the bearings and insert the hex key all the way through the Y tensioner. Note that you shall insert from the side which is not chamfered.

- ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Dual_Belt_Plus/DB+3.JPG)

- The bearings should look as shown.

- ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Dual_Belt_Plus/DB+4.JPG)

- Now, insert the pin from the **chamfered side** and use the pin to replace and push the hex key out of the bearings. 

- ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Dual_Belt_Plus/DB+5.JPG)

Insert the pin all the way to the end. Use a 3mm hex key to assist and make sure the pin is at the end.

- ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Dual_Belt_Plus/DB+8.JPG)

The new Dual Belt Plus tensioner is complete!

- ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Dual_Belt_Plus/DB+10.JPG)

- Pass the two belts through the Y tensioner as shown.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/db/db5.png)

- Connect the timing belt as shown. Make sure the belts reach the end. Otherwise, the belt length will be different.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/db/db6.png)

Insert the M3x32mm screw(the longest one) into the Y tensioner. 

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/db/db6.5.png)

- Install the timing belt into the Y-Belt-Clip as shown. Put 2 M3x12 screws in advance.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/db/db8.png)

- Put Y Belt Clip into Y Belt Holder B, the upper cover of the Y holder.

- Attach Y Belt Holder B to Y Belt Holder A. Make sure you turn the screws on both sides evenly in turn.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/db/db9.png)

### 5.4 The final assembly

- Put the Dual belt driving pulley on the Y motor shaft, as close to the motor side as possible, leaving a very small gap only. Make sure the pulley is not touching the motor.


![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/db/db10.png)

- Put the timing belt around the pulley, let the teeth match the belt

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/db/db11.png)

- Install the adjusting screw(M3x12mm) and leave a proper distance. If the belt does not fully match the driving pulley or the left and right belt does not have the same tension. Just move the Y carriage back and forth when the belt is under tension until the two belts are working properly.

- We will fine tune the belt tension later according to the printing test.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/db/DB13.jpg)

- The Y tensioner  should be installed as shown.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Dual_Belt_Plus/DB14.JPG)


## 6. Replace the E motor (additional)

Prorifi3D E motors have the same dimension as the original one. It is a direct replacement. You can refer to this section to rebuild the E axis:[https://help.prusa3d.com/en/guide/5-e-axis-assembly_28536](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/guide/5-e-axis-assembly_28536)

## 7. Electronics

- The electronics are the same as the original i3. You can find the reference here:[https://help.prusa3d.com/en/guide/8-electronics-assembly_34416](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/guide/8-electronics-assembly_34416)

- Do this before install the control box

## 8. Install the control box

- Hook the control box on the holder as shown.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Cbox_install.png)


- Tighten the screws.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Stage_2/Cbox_install_2.png)

## 9. Spool holder

- Install the spool holder with flat cap M5x10 screws and hammer nuts.

## 10. Performance boost (optional) 

### 10.1 Install the heat sinks

- To get an extra performance boost, you can install the heatsink first. This will lower the motor running temperature, allowing a larger current and better stability.

- For Y motors we recommend you install as shown:

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Performence_boost/Y_motor.jpg)

- For X motors we recommend you install as shown:

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Performence_boost/X_motor.jpg)

### 10.2 Changing the motor current

- You can change the current via Gcode

- First, connect your printer using USB cable

- Use Pronterface to connect your printer

- Change the RMS current of your XY motor using

```
M907 X520 Y520
```

- Save the settings by typing

```
M500
```


## 12. Belt tension adjust

- First set your belt to the lowest tension. You can use phone apps to determine the vibration frequency of your belt. For the Original i3 Mk3 series the minimum value should be about 54Hz.

- You can use phone apps to measure the belt vibration frequency.

- When measuring the belt frequency, push the heated bed all the way to the back (where the motor is). Slightly picking the lower belt in the middle as shown. You can use a hex key to assist. For the Dual belt system just pick one of the belts.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/Belt_tension/Belt_tension_dual.jpg)

- Print the [Test block](https://github.com/Prorifi3D-Official/Prorifi3D-Upgrades/tree/main/Test%20files), you may see there are vertical patterns with 2mm separations on the Y axis. This means your belt is too loose. 

- Slowly tighten the belt, and print the test block. Until you see the 2mm separations disappear completely. This tension should be ideal, you can record the current belt frequency for later reference.

- After the 2mm pattern is not visible as you increase the tension, you should keep tighting the belt untill the MRR is at its minimal. The ideal tension for the Dual Belt system with frame upgrade is relative high.
